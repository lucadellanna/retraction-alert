# Retraction Alert — Chrome Web Store Listing Draft

**Short description**  
Warns when the article being viewed—or any of its citations—has been retracted or flagged.

**Long description**  
Retraction Alert automatically checks scholarly articles for retraction status using Crossref (Retraction Watch/assertions/update-to).  
• Shows a clear red banner if the current article is retracted/withdrawn/flagged.  
• Scans cited references (DOIs) via Crossref: shows a yellow progress bar while checking, then a red banner if any cited papers are flagged, or a green banner if all checked are clear.  
• If flagged citations exist and a corresponding-author email is found, offers a one-click “Email corresponding author” mailto draft listing the retracted citations.  
• Runs automatically—no popup or background UI needed.

**Supported sites**

**Privacy**
